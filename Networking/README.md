# Networking Exercises

Lab material covering core networking concepts from the OSI model up to application protocols.
Files range from short markdown questions to full C client/server programs.

## Interesting folders

- **ApplicationLayer**, **TransportLayer**, **NetworkLayer** – markdown exercises per layer.
- **final_project** – client and server implementations in C.
- **application_layer_part_2** – small HTTP examples and scripts.
- **firewalls** – notes and exercises on firewall configuration.

## Building

Most C code can be compiled with `gcc *.c -o program`. For the final project build both client and server source files.
