# C Exercises

This folder contains various C language practice files. Exercises cover fundamental topics like pointers, arrays, bitwise operations and structs.

## Interesting folders

- **BuildProcess/Linking** – demonstrates building multi‑file programs.
- **Debugging_Tools** – simple programs meant for practising debugging.
- **src** – main exercise implementations.
- **test** – small test programs for some exercises.

## Building

Most files can be compiled individually with `gcc file.c -o prog`. The system_programming folder includes makefiles for larger examples.
