# Cyber Security Labs

Materials exploring offensive and defensive security topics.
Folders include written exercises as well as small scripts and Docker setups.

## Interesting folders

- **brute_force**, **recon**, **permissions** – introductory attack techniques.
- **network_based_defence** – contains Docker compose files for server setups.
- **command_and_control** and **kill_chain** – examples of simple C&C and kill chain steps.
- **reversing** and **web_exploitation** – short reversing and web hacking challenges.

## Running examples

Some exercises use Python or C and can be executed directly.
The *network_based_defence* project requires Docker and `docker-compose` to run the servers.
