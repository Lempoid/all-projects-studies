| Gather Victim Identity Information - personal information from names to mails and credentials. <br>May be done with phishing or OSINT and probing.  | Serverless - adversaries use AWS lambda, Cloudflare Workers, Google Apps Scripts to be used during targeting. This makes it harder attributing infrastructure back to them | Trusted Relationship - Adversaries may breach or leverage organisations which the target trust and through those gain access to target. | Scheduled Task/Job - Adversaries use scheduling functionality to run malicious code at specific times.                      | Screensaver - Adversaries establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity.                                         | Proc Memory - Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.                                | Rootkit - Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information. | Exploitation for Credential Access - Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials.                                                   | Browser Information Discovery - Adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised environments. Data saved by browsers (such as bookmarks, accounts, and browsing history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking sites, relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure. | Replication Through Removable Media - Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Clipboard Data - Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.                                                                       | Data Obfuscation - Adversaries may obfuscate command and control traffic to make it more difficult to detect.                                                                   | Data Transfer Size Limits - An adversary may exfiltrate data in fixed size chunks instead of whole files or limit packet sizes below certain thresholds. This approach may be used to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts. | Financial Theft - Adversaries may steal monetary resources from targets through extortion, social engineering, technical theft, or other methods aimed at their own financial gain at the expense of the availability of these resources for victims.                          |
| Search Closed Sources - Information is gathered from private sources and databases. Sometimes bought on the dark web.                               | Code Signing Certificates - adversaries sign their code and executables, which makes users/sec tools to trust it more.                                                     | Hardware Additions - adding computer/network devices into a system or network.                                                          | System Services - Adversaries may use daemons or system services to run malicious content. Some of those may start at boot. | Unix Shell Configuration Modification - Adversaries may establish persistence by executing commands triggered by user's shell configuration scripts. | Setuid and Setgid - An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. | Template Injection - Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts.                                                                                                                                                        | MFA Request Generation - Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users. | Debugger Evasion - Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid debuggers. Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyse the execution of potential malware payloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Software Deployment Tools - Adversaries may gain access to and use centralized software suites installed within an enterprise to execute commands and move laterally through the network. Configuration management and software deployment applications may be used in an enterprise network or cloud environment for routine administration purposes. These systems may also be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Examples of such solutions include: SCCM, HBSS, Altiris, AWS Systems Manager, Microsoft Intune, Azure Arc, and GCP Deployment Manager. | Data From Local System - Adversaries may search local system sources, such as file systems and configuration files or local databases, to find files of interest and sensitive data prior to Exfiltration. | Application Layer Protocol -   <br>Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. | Scheduled Transfer - Adversaries may schedule data exfiltration to be performed only at certain times of day or at certain intervals. This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.                       | Firmware Corruption - Adversaries may overwrite or corrupt the flash memory contents of system BIOS or other firmware in devices attached to a system in order to render them inoperable or unable to boot, thus denying the availability to use the devices and/or the system |
