If I write no direct comparisons, that means the the counterpart is directly opposite to what I write.

The asm file lacks addresses and is much less structured.
The binary disassembly will contain sections and more metadata: debug info, symbol tables  etc.
Compiling asm file into binary may use optimisation and reorganisation of the code.
