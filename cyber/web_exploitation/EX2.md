```
summary: Installation of bWAPP web.
```
1) Download bWAPP VM.
   `wget https://tinyurl.com/5fjh2c5v -O bWAPP.zip`
    I used tiny url because I didn't have the strength to decode url stuff. Here is the original: `https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/bwapp/bWAPP/bWAPPv2.2/bWAPPv2.2.zip?ts=gAAAAABnoMV6xyp1Oay3xjSFsdTh6ru8iA9uDwwuChlLTY7SRC571PinQwjkjccDjjtY9ogXo6qy6seOhOHLqISs5u2YVfy_YA%3D%3D&use_mirror=yer&r=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2F`

2) Unzip `unzip bWAPP.zip`
VM had too many issues, no time to fix. Moving to web option.
