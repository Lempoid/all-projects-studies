# System Programming

Practice projects dealing with low level and POSIX programming.
Examples include memory mapping, multi-threaded code and parsing the EXT2 file system.

## Interesting folders

- **DumbDumber** – experiments with stack frames and executables.
- **Libraries** – shows how to build static and dynamic libraries.
- **MemoryMappingBasic** – simple memory mapping demos.
- **SimpleMakeFile** – a makefile example for compiling `foo.c`.
- **src** and **test** – implementation files and unit tests.

## Building

Many examples use makefiles. Try `make -C src` or `make -C SimpleMakeFile` to build provided demos.
